# Sepples Predicate Tutorial

*The last three words of this sentence are a predicate.*

???

Might be a bit too in-depth.

---

## What is a (language) predicate?

A predicate asserts something about the subject.

"The cat *is furry*."

---

## What is a (code) predicate?

A predicate *evaluates* an assertion about the subject.

```cpp
// pseudocode
bool is_furry(subject)
{
    return (subject == cat);
}
```

The predicate here evaluates the subject, and determines if it is furry.

---

## Purity

Unary and binary predicates must:

- Never modify the objects.
- Give the same result every time.

---

## Using Unary Predicates

A good use of unary predicates is the `std::partition` algorithm.

```cpp
template <typename BI, typename UP>
BI partition( BI first, BI last, UP pred );
```

???

BI is a BidirectionalIterator
UP is a UnaryPredicate

---

## Let's Partition!

First, we need a container:

```cpp
vector<int> my_vec =
	{ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
```

Let's partition the numbers with the predicate that
they are divisibe by a certain integer.

---

## Naive Predicate

First attempt:

```cpp
bool is_divisible_by_seven( int i )
{
	return ( i%7 == 0 );
}
```

---

## Naive Predicate Usage

```cpp
partition( my_vec.begin(), my_vec.end(),
	is_divisible_by_seven);
```

This is a good start, but it only works for the number `7`.

To change the number, we must change the function.
To have multiple numbers, we need multiple functions.

---

## Templatized Predicate

Second attempt:

```cpp
template < int N >
bool is_divisible_by( int i )
{
	return ( i%N == 0 );
}
```

---

## Templatized Predicate Usage

```cpp
partition( my_vec.begin(), my_vec.end(),
	is_divisible_by< 7 > );
```

Much better, but what if we can't know `N` at compile time?

---

## Function Object Predicate

Final attempt:

```cpp
struct is_divisible_by
{
	int N;
	
	is_divisible_by(int n) // constructor
		: N( n ) {}
	
	bool operator()(int i) const
	{
		return ( i%N == 0 );
	}
}
```

---

## Function Object Predicate Usage

```cpp
partition( my_vec.begin(), my_vec.end(),
	is_divisible_by( 7 ) );
```

Excellent!

The function object can take any number now, even during run-time.

```cpp
cin >> x;
partition( my_vec.begin(), my_vec.end(),
	is_divisible_by( x ) );
```

*Remember the cats.*

---

## Binary Predicate

A subject can consist of multiple nouns.

```cpp
bool is_furrier(Animal x, Animal y)
{
    return (x.fur > y.fur);
}
```

Binary predicates are most often used to compare two items.

???

Sort, remove, copy_if.

I promise it's necessary.

## Properties of Relations

Let `~` be a binary relation.

- **Reflexive**: `(x ~ x)`.
- **Symmetric**: `(x ~ y && y ~ x)`.
- **Transitive**: `(x ~ y && y ~ z)` implies `x ~ z`.

We also define:

- **Equivalence**: `!(x ~ y || y ~ x)` implies `x <=> y`.
  - Equivalence is transitive.
  - Does not always imply equality.

---

## Ordering Relations

Binary predicates are commonly used to define an ordering of a set.

An ordering is a relation that determines if an object precedes another
object in the same set.

All ordering relations are *asymmetric* and *transitive*.

---

## Partial Order

- Reflexive
- Asymmetric
- Transitive

---

## Strict Weak Order

Most C++ algorithms require a strict weak ordering predicate.

- Irreflexive
- Asymmetric
- Transitive
- Equivalence

---

## Total Order

Total ordering is similar to strict weak ordering.

- Equivalence implies equality.

---

## Pop Quiz

Classify these relations for `x` and `y` in **R**.

- .no-break[`x == y`]
- .no-break[`x != y`]
- .no-break[`x <  y`]
- .no-break[`x >  y`]
- .no-break[`x <= y`]
- .no-break[`x >= y`]

---

## You Pass!

Answers:

- .no-break[`x == y`] : No ordering; symmetric; no equivalence.
- .no-break[`x != y`] : No ordering; symmetric; intransitive.
- .no-break[`x <  y`] : Total ordering.
- .no-break[`x >  y`] : Total ordering.
- .no-break[`x <= y`] : Partial ordering; reflexive.
- .no-break[`x >= y`] : Partial ordering; reflexive.

---

## Why not `<=`?

Since `<=` and `>=` don't define a strict weak order,
they can't be used in many algorithms.

In a strict weak ordering, `!(x ~ y || y ~ x)` means that `x` and `y` are equivalent.
However, if `!(x <= y || y <= x)`, they are certainly not equivalent.

They are *incomparable*.

Any relation `~` such that `(x ~ y)` could be undefined gives
no more than a partial ordering,
and cannot be use e.g. in sorting algorithms.

---

## Mumbo Jumbo - What's it all mean?

Most standard algorithms require strice weak ordering predicates.

They default to `std::less<T>`, a wrapper around `x < y`.
